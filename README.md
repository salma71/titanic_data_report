# Titanic disaster report in Python

## Introduction

I used my skills in Python to analyze the Titanic catastrophic accident by asking questions and search for answers. 

## Problem

some of the basic questions were:

    1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
    2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
    3.) Where did the passengers come from?
    4.) Who was alone and who was with family?
    5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
    6.) Did having a family member increase the chance to survive?
    
## Results

I found some interesting facts. Some of them are but not limited to:

    * Females had a higher chance to be rescued than males.
    * passengers with higher class tickets had a better chance to survive.
    * Most of the Third class were men.
    * Most of the Third class were from Brooklyne.
    * Children had a better chance to survive regardless their boarding class ticket.
    * Families had a better chance to survive.

## Technologies used

More than one library used to create that report. 

    * Numpy, Panda were used to handle working with series and data frames. 
    * Both Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries were used to visualize the results nicely. 
    * Other helper functions were written in pure Python.

## Data collection

The data collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) as a Machine Learning from Disaster. The idea was to predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics.
