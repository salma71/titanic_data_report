## Titanic disaster report in Python
======
...I used my skills in Python to analyze the Titanic catastrophic accident. I found some interesting facts. Some of them are but not limited to:

* People who had their family on deck had a better chance to survive than the single passengers.
* Females had a higher chance to be rescued than males.
* passengers with more top class tickets had a better chance to survive.
* Most of the Third class were men.
* Younger passengers had a better chance to survive regardless their boarding class ticket.
